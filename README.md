# Meet

## Summary

A responsive, progressive web app built in React, using test-driven development techniques that is available cross-platform. 
It utilises serverless functions available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Google Oauth and Google Calendar API to 
fetch upcoming events and display them on the front end.
Users are prompted to add a shortcut to the app on their homescreen, and can access the app offline.  
Recharts is used to display data visually on the front-end.

Integration and unit testing was done with Jest.
